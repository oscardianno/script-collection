# Script collection
This is a personal collection of scripts I often find useful. Most of them were made by me, unless otherwise stated.

* **Phoenix Daemon**: it's a VBS script that keeps launching PhoenixMiner (and the overclock tool for AMD cards called OverdriveNTool) when it detects it closed. Useful when a card or the miner is failing, so it re-launches it automatically. Requires to edit and set the paths for such executables.
* **noAdmin**: drag and drop a program on this to skip the requirement of giving admin rights to it. Some programs will still ask for it.
* **vlc_multitrack**: drag and drop a video file on this to open it with VLC and playback multiple audio tracks of it at the same time.
* **waReplayRes**: drag and drop a Worms Armageddon replay file to open it with a custom resolution (by default 800x600). Useful for recording plays. It restores the previous resolution after closing. Made by @cgarz
