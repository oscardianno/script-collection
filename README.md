# Script collection

This is a personal collection of scripts I often find useful. Most of them were made by me, unless otherwise stated.

- **create-virtual-disk**: create a 2GB RAM disk using ImDisk.
- **get-lock-screen-wallpapers**: batch script to gather Windows 10's lock screens wallpapers from their temporary folders.
- **no-admin**: drag and drop a program on this to skip the requirement of giving admin rights to it. Some programs will still ask for it.
- **PhoenixDaemon**: it's a VBS script that keeps launching PhoenixMiner (and the overclock tool for AMD cards called OverdriveNTool) when it detects it closed. Useful when a card or the miner is failing, so it re-launches it automatically. Requires to edit and set the paths for such executables.
- **vlc-multitrack**: drag and drop a video file on this to open it with VLC and playback multiple audio tracks of it at the same time. Useful when, for example, reproducing a video recorded with NVIDIA GeForce Experience with the Separate audio tracks option enabled.
- **wa-replay-res**: drag and drop a Worms Armageddon replay file to open it with a custom resolution (by default 800x600). Useful for recording plays. It restores the previous resolution after closing. Made by @cgarz
- **wa-zoom**: use Windows magnifier to zoom the screen with a bottom anchor as a fixed position.
- **yt-playlist-backup**: create a playlist backup in a XLSX file from the output of yt-dl. Also tries to recover the title and other metadata of videos that are no longer available.
